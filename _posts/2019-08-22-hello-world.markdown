##  Hello world!
This is my first blog post. I am passionate about writing and I take special efforts to learn it.  Writing is an essential activity of a scientist. Very few, however, take it seriously. Writing is an art. Hence, all rules of learning an art such as painting also applies to learning to write. The most essential rule is to practice indefinitely. Hence, I am assigning a big responsibility to myself today, which is to write blog posts regularly and keep the website alive. It is not an easy task and I am well aware of that. I have started many things in the past and almost every time I struggled to keep up and failed terribly. The lessons from those failures, I believe, will help me to keep up with this new activity I am starting today. 

### What am I going to write about?
This website is purely for my academic writings. Hence, I'll write about my research work, for example, about a paper I publish; about research works of others that I am interested in; about research talks I listen to at conferences or at seminars; about books that I read; about my life as a scientist. 

### Who am I writing to?
The writing style strongly depends on the type of audience one is writing to. I expect the readers to be mostly people from my research network. Hence, I assume that the readers are familiar with basic concepts of my research areas of interest.
