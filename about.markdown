**Dr. Veera Manikandan Rajagopal, MD, PhD**


I am a postdoctoral researcher at Department of Biomedicine, Aarhus University. I work under the leadership of Prof. Anders Borglum. Anders is one of the principal investigators of iPSYCH (<https://ipsych.au.dk/about-ipsych/>) and is also the head of personalised medicine research group in Aarhus University (<https://biomed.au.dk/research/personalised-medicine/>). 

I have two major research areas of interest. 

1.  I am interested in understanding the genetic mechanisms behind cognitive dysfunction in psychiatric disorders. I study using a genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach. I conduct GWASs of cognitive traits in the general population as well as in individuals with psychiatric disorders. I particularly probe the genetic findings that are shared between cognitive traits and psychiatric disorders.
2.  I am interested in understanding the role of gene expression regulation as a mediator of the association between genetic variations and human diseases. Particularly, I study gene expression regulation in brain and how it is affected by the risk variants shared between cognitive traits and psychiatric disorders. I study this with respect to space and time, i.e., across different brain regions and across different developmental stages.
